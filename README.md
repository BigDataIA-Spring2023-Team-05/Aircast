### Overview about our Application
This is a complete system ensuring user to get access to Air Quality Prediction. It helps to provide advance warning to our application users about potential air quality problems. This allows people to take precautions to protect their health, such as staying indoors or wearing masks. It also enables policymakers to take action to mitigate the effects of poor air quality, such as implementing restrictions on certain activities that contribute to air pollution.
